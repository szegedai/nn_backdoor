# nn_backdoor
Neural networks for the Fooling a Complete Neural Network Verifier paper (ICLR 2021)

## Supported formats
You can download and test the network and its backdoored variant what we used in our paper in the following formats:
 * [tensorflow 1.11(.meta)](https://github.com/szegedai/nn_backdoor/tree/master/tf1_11)
 * [tensorflow 2.1(.h5 or .mat)](https://github.com/szegedai/nn_backdoor/tree/master/tf2_1)
 * [onnx](https://github.com/szegedai/nn_backdoor/tree/master/onnx)
 * [nnet](https://github.com/szegedai/nn_backdoor/tree/master/nnet)

## Building a network with backdoor
We also add a sample code, which demonstrates how we install the backdoor to the wk17a network from [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00851) work.
You can find it [here](https://github.com/szegedai/nn_backdoor/tree/master/tf2_1) under the _Adding Backdoor to a model_ section.
* [tensorflow 2.1(.h5 or .mat)]
